# Sudoku Project Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

The sudoku project has been successfully refactored with the following changes:

### New Structure

```
sudoku/
├── internal/
│   ├── board/
│   │   └── board.go        (combined board.go + validation.go)
│   ├── generator/
│   │   └── generator.go    (refactored from generator.go)
│   └── solver/
│       └── solver.go       (refactored from solver.go)
├── main.go                 (updated with new imports)
└── go.mod                  (unchanged)
```

### Package Changes

1. **internal/board** - Contains all board-related functionality:
   - Board struct and methods
   - Validation functions
   - Helper functions for position mapping
   - Exported helper functions: GetPosToRow, GetPosToCol, GetPosToBox

2. **internal/solver** - Contains solving algorithms:
   - Solver struct and methods
   - Constraint propagation
   - Backtracking algorithm
   - MRV heuristic
   - Changed: `NewSolver` → `solver.New`
   - Changed: `SolverOptions` → `solver.Options`
   - Exported: `PropagateConstraints` and `FindMRVCell` for use by generator

3. **internal/generator** - Contains puzzle generation:
   - Generator struct and methods
   - Puzzle creation with configurable difficulty
   - Solution uniqueness verification
   - Changed: `NewGenerator` → `generator.New`
   - Changed: `GeneratorOptions` → `generator.Options`

### Files to Remove

The following files in the root directory are now obsolete and should be removed:
- `board.go` (moved to internal/board/board.go)
- `solver.go` (moved to internal/solver/solver.go)
- `generator.go` (moved to internal/generator/generator.go)
- `validation.go` (merged into internal/board/board.go)

### To Complete the Refactoring

Run these commands from the project root:

```bash
rm board.go
rm solver.go  
rm generator.go
rm validation.go
```

Then test the refactored code:

```bash
go mod tidy
go build
./sudoku
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Code is now organized by functional domain
2. **Clear Package Boundaries**: Each package has a specific responsibility
3. **Internal Package**: Using `internal/` prevents external dependencies
4. **Cleaner Imports**: More explicit about what functionality comes from where
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify related code
